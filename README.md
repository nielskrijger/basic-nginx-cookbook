basic-nginx cookbook
====================

This Chef cookbook installs nginx.

This basic-nginx cookbook has very limited configurability and likely you'll want to use
the a community nginx cookbook for your deployments instead.

Personally I find the community cookbooks too complicated; this cookbook is tailored to meet
my personal needs.

# Getting started

You need Kitchen CI (http://kitchen.ci/) to run a test VM.

Enter the following command to create a running instance:

    kitchen converge default-centos-65

To open a command line SSH connection, run the following:

    kitchen login default-centos-65

To test whether the install is working property execute:

    kitchen verify default-centos-65
